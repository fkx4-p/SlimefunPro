# Slimefun 4
Slimefun is a plugin which aims to turn your Bukkit/Spigot Server into a modpack without ever installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks! Slimefun lets every player decide on their own how much they want to dive into Magic or Tech.<br>
We got everything from magical wands to nuclear reactors.<br>
We feature a magical altar, an electric power grid and even item transport systems.

This project originally started back in 2013 and has grown ever since.<br>
From one single person working on this plugin back then, we grew to a community of thousands of players and over 100 of contributors to this project.<br>
It currently adds over **500 new items and recipes** to Minecraft ([Read more about the history of this project](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Slimefun-in-a-nutshell)).

But it also comes with a lot of Addons too!<br>
Check out our [Addons](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons), you may find exactly what you were looking for.

## Download Slimefun 4
Slimefun 4 can be downloaded for free on our builds page.<br>
We currently provide two versions of Slimefun, development builds and "stable" builds.<br>
Here is a full summary of the differences between these two versions of Slimefun.

| | development builds | "stable" builds |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| **Supported Minecraft version(s)** | 1.14.X - 1.15.X | 1.14.X - 1.15.X |
| **extensive testing before release** | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **latest content** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **Discord support** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **Bug Reports** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **frequent updates & fast patches** | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: |
| **change logs** | :x: | :memo: **[change log](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)** |
| **Download** | :package: **[download development build](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/master/)** | :package: **[download "stable" build](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/stable/)** |

**We wholeheartedly recommend you to use development builds.**<br>
But we can understand the use of "stable" builds if your server's livelihood heavily depends on Slimefun.<br>
We do recommend you to keep on auto-updates to receive automatic patches and fixes for Slimefun.<br>
If you worry about features from Slimefun breaking due to an update (rarely happens), then you may wanna use a "stable" build to be sure, but we will not provide any support for it on discord nor on our issue tracker.<br>
Development builds are uploaded automatically making the maintenance of a proper change log very hard.

  </a>
</p>

**Important**: "stable" is in quotes because these builds have gone through a testing period before their release, they are safe to use. However due to this testing period, updates will happen very rarely, so any bugs that arise will not be fixed until the next major update. Development builds receive very frequent updates and patches, so these may (ironically) perform better than "stable" builds. We will also provide no support on discord nor the issue tracker for "stable" builds, as "stable" builds can be outdated by weeks or even months due to their infrequent update schedule.

## Disclaimer
Slimefun4 uses various systems that collect usage information or download automatic updates as well as the latest information about the project.<br>
We do __not__ collect any personal information from you but here is a full list of what services may collect or download other kinds of data.

You can opt-out of the Auto-Updater and stats collection at any time.

### Auto-Updates
Slimefun4 uses an Auto-Updater which connects to https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/ to check for and download updates.<br>
This behaviour is enabled by default but can be turned off under `/plugins/Slimefun/config.yml`<br>
We highly recommend you to keep this on at any time though, as you could be missing out on important patches.

### Metrics and Statistics
Slimefun4 uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574) to collect anonymous information about the usage of this plugin.<br>
This is solely for statistical purposes, as we are interested in how Servers/Players use this plugin.<br>
All available data is anonymous and aggregated, at no point can we see individual server or player information.<br>
All of the collected data is publicly accessible: https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Slimefun/4574

You can also disable this behaviour under `/plugins/bStats/config.yml`.<br>
For more info see [bStats' Privacy Policy](https://bstats.org/privacy-policy)

### GitHub Integration
Lastly, Slimefun4 connects to https://api.github.com/ to gather information about this open-source project.<br>
No information about your Minecraft Server is sent to GitHub.

This information includes (but is not limited to)
* list of contributors, their username and profile link (from the repositories `TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4`, `TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki` and `TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Resourcepack`)
* amount of open issues in this repository
* amount of pending pull requests in this repository
* amount of stars in this repository
* amount of forks of this repository
* amount of code-bytes in this repository
* date of the last commit to this repository

Additionally the plugin connects to https://mojang.com/ to retrieve the Minecraft skins of our contributors (if possible).<br>
Note that this project is not associated with Mojang AB.
